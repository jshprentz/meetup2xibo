.. Start description

**Meetup2xibo** is a command line program that retrieves event descriptions
from Meetup.com and loads them into a Xibo digital signage dataset.
Xibo can display events in sign layouts such as agendas, calendars, room
activity signs, and maps.

Meetup2xibo was developed for `Nova Labs`_, a makerspace in Reston, Virginia.
The busy Nova Labs calendar has up to a dozen Meetup.com events per day.
Xibo displays event agendas for today and tommorrow on several large
wall-mounted monitors.
Meetup2xibo keeps those agendas up-to-date as events are added, cancelled, or updated.
