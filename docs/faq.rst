Explain the feature "Remove accounting codes from event titles"
---------------------------------------------------------------

Most Nova Labs event names begin with a two-character accounting code such as
*EL* for electronics.
Meetup2xibo removes accounting codes while converting events from Meetup.com format to
Xibo format.
For example, "EL: Electronics 101" becomes "Electronics 101."
This feature is not configurable.
