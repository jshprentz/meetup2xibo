Logging
=======

:program:`Meetup2xibo` logs its activity to a log file and optionally to the
console *(stderr).*
Command line flags control which log messages should be directed to which
destinations.
Supporting program :program:`summarize-m2x-logs` summarizes log files,
reporting on meetup2xibo runs and event changes.

Log Destinations
----------------

By default, meetup2xibo writes log messages to file :file:`meetup2xibo.log` in
the current directory.
The :option:`-t <meetup2xibo -l>` option can specify an alternate path to the
log file.
The :option:`-v <meetup2xibo -v>` option adds console output.
The :option:`-w <meetup2xibo -w>` option adds console output and limits the
console log level to warnings and errors.

Log Levels
----------

By default, meetup2xibo logs only info, warning, and error messages.
The :option:`-d <meetup2xibo -d>` option adds debug level messages, which help
software developers.
As described above, the :option:`-w <meetup2xibo -w>` option adds console
output and limits the console log level to warnings and errors.
:numref:`Table %s <log-levels>` summarizes the log levels and the impact of the
:option:`-d <meetup2xibo -d>` and :option:`-w <meetup2xibo -w>` flags.

Log Summaries
-------------

Summarize-m2x-logs summarizes one or more meetup2xibo log files.
The summary includes:

- Counts of meetup2xibo runs, by version
- Lists of events inserted, updated, deleted, and retired
- Field-by-field details of updated events
- Warnings about missing event locations
- Warnings about special event locations no longer needed
- Spreadsheet showing conversions from Meetup.com locations to Xibo locations

:ref:`summarizer-cron-job` describes how to run summarize-m2x-logs daily and send the
HTML-formatted results via email.
:numref:`Figure %s <summary-email>` shows an example of the daily email message.

   The daily summary email message count meetup2xibo runs and list Xibo event changes.

An email message attachment contains a CSV formatted file listing the
conversions from Meetup.com venue name and how-to-find-us fields to Xibo
locations.
An administrator can review the CSV file in Microsoft Excel or another
spreadsheet program.
The administrator can resolve location conversion anomalies by editing the
Meetup.com event or by adding a new location phrase or special location to the
meetup2xibo configuration.
:numref:`Figure %s <location-spreadsheet>` shows an example of the location conversion
spreadsheet.
